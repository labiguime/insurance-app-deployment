- Go to Amazon CodePipeline
- Create new pipeline
- Enter a name for the pipeline (insurance-production for instance)
- Create a new service role (or could use existing, but create new the first time)
- Role name should be generated automatically but could be customized if you want to identify it more easily
- For source stage select github and choose all the right parameters
- When at the codebuild step, create new build project. A popup window should appear
- Select a CodeBuild project name (insurance-production-codebuild for instance)
- Under Environment choose: Managed Image, operating system=Ubuntu, Runtime= Standard, image = standard:4.0 leave the rest to default and check the box under Privileged
- Under service role create a new service role or you could use an existing one if creating a development or staging pipeline. /!\ Keep that service role name in mind
- Go to additional configuration and add the following environment variables:

(Modify if necessary)
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID 122119488469 /!\ To change for sure
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION ca-central-1
IMAGE_REPO_NAME haywards-ecr /!\
CB_ENV staging
CB_MASTER_KEY 

- Select next and the popup window should disappear
- Back to the pipeline creation page, select next
- On deploy stage page, choose your application and the corresponding environment

The pipeline is now created but should fail at build. To fix it, do the following:
- Go to the IAM console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home).
- Under policies (navigation panel on the left), create a new policy that will correspond to the content of the "codebuild_policy.json" file located in the README folder. /!\ Keep the name of the created policy in mind
- Then, go to Roles, and for the service role that you created earlier (whom name you should have kept in mind), attach the policy that you just created.
- Go back to your pipeline and retry for the failed step.
- Your project should deploy after a short while (it will take 4-5 min the first time).
